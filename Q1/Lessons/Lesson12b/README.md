# Lesson 12b

## Divisible By 3

Write a program that determines if a user-inputted number is divisible by 3.
The code should display an appropriate message as the result.
(Note: You must instantiate the Scanner object!!)

## Even Or Odd

Write a program that determines if a user-inputted number is even or odd.
The code should display an appropriate message if the result is even or odd.

## Valid Username

On a certain network, usernames are required to start with the letter ‘U’, and be more than 6 characters in length.
Write a program that takes a prospective username (a String) as input,
and determines if the String meets the network’s username requirements.

Your code should advise the user if their username choice is illegal, and the reason.
(Note: You must instantiate the Scanner object!!)
