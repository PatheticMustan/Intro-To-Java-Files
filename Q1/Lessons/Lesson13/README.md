# Lesson 13

## Increments

Use the following values to determine the difference between i++ and ++i for an integer i.

```java
int x = 7, x1 = 7;
int y = x++;
int y1 = ++x1;
```

Print the results of all variables to determine the difference. Comment your conclusion in your code.

## CompareTo for Strings

Generalize the return value of compareTo for Strings.
Print the results of multiple comparisons to determine when the result is positive, negative, or 0.
Comment your conclusion in your code.

## Grades

Write a program that accepts a numerical grade from the user, and displays the following:

- A if (grade >= 94 and <= 100)
- B if (grade >= 85 and < 94)
- C if (grade >= 75 and < 85)
- D if (grade >= 60 and < 75)
- F if (grade < 60)
